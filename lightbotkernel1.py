* initial terrain and colors should be given as a matrix (a numpy array).

* position should be given as (y,x).  **notice that y values increase as you go down, x values increase as you go right.**

  Iâ€™ve defined right as east, left as west, etc.  
  these directions are fixed and do not change based on the direction you are facing. 
  in other words, whether you are facing north, south, east, or west, 
  right will always mean east and left will always mean west according to their geographical positions.
  However, turn commands depend on your current orientation. For instance,
  if you are already facing right (east), the command "turn right" will make you turn to "your right",
  causing you to face "down" (south).
 apologies for any confusion. 
 the reason I labeled them this way is that I assumed everyone would naturally think of directions in this format, 
 regardless of their orientation.
